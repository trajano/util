  <shortDescription>A set of utility JSPs.</shortDescription>
    <description>This provides a set of utility JSPs that can be used in debugging JNDI, JMS, JDBC and EJBs.  These JSPs
  are standalone and do not require any dependencies aside from being in a J2EE container.  The JSPs can also be extracted 
and put into other projects that might have resources that are in the java: tree.  This project also serves as a sample web application that is integration tested with Cactus.</description>
